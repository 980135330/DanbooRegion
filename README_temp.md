# the DanbooRegion 2020 Dataset

![img0](https://lllyasviel.github.io/DanbooRegion/page_imgs/teaser.jpg)

DanbooRegion is a project conducted by ToS2P (the Team of Style2Paints), aiming at find a solution to extract regions from illustrations and cartoon images, so that many region-based image processing algrithoms can be applied to in-the-wild illustration and digital paintings. The main uniqueness of this project is that our dataset is created by real artists in a semi-automatic manner. 

This project begins at 2019 Jan and a techinical paper, namely "DanbooRegion: Illustration and Cartoon Region Dataset Annotated by Real-life Artists", is accepted to the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2020.

# Table of Contents

In this page, we provide the following contents:

    1. Downloding the region annotation dataset.
    2. Converting regions to learnable skeleton maps.
    3. Converting the entire dataset to learnable skeleton maps.
    4. Training a neural network to predict the skeleton maps.
    5. Converting a skeleton map to regions.
    6. Developing your own framework and train it on this dataset.
    7. Benchmarking the performace of your model.

However, if you are busy dating your girlfriend, or in a great hurry to write a paper, you can skip the 1234567 above and directly jump to the 89 below.

    8. Downloding the pre-trained model.
    9. Testing the model with an image.

We also provide some additional playful contents.

    10. Playing with some applications.
    11. Playing with some configuations.
